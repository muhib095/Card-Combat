# Card-Combat V2

My project involves creating a simple card game that involves the user going against the computer. 
There are no ties so the user must input an odd number of rounds. The user and computer are dealt random cards that range from 1-13. 
You must have a greater card than the computer to win the round. You can re-roll your card once per round. 

There are 2 win conditions. First, you must win a majority of the rounds. If there are 3 rounds, you must win 2 of them. 
Lastly, you must accumulate more than 30 points. You start with 20 points. 
Points are accumulated by calculating the difference between the playerâ€™s card value and the computer's card value

Good Luck!
